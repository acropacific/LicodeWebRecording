# LicodeWebRecording
A web application based on Licode Platform to realize web recording 
This is my first web application. When developing a web application, told by Pedro, try to assign tasks among servers and clients properly. 
Generally, if more is assigned to servers, the application is safer.

Need to take care of  node modules version. Some may be too new to use. like mongojs, socket.io-client.
when fack client cannot connect to the room, ./installNuve.sh again.`
